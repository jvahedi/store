The needs highlighted include research into data integration, enhancing data quality, exploring the potential of extending successful models to more jurisdictions, establishing a National Crime Information Center, studying the impact of faster funding processes, developing a framework for mitigating cybercrime, and exploring the application of private sector technologies in criminal justice."
49,49,32,Data Acquisition Challenges,Challenges and Solutions in Data Acquisition from Providers for Legal Processes,"The common themes and terms revolve around the difficulties faced by agencies in obtaining and using data from different providers, especially for legal processes. Challenges include unclear procedures, jurisdictional issues, communication with providers' legal representatives, and the usability of returned data. The needs identified include research on model statutes, development of standards, a system for preparing compliant warrants, an information exchange system, and a liaison or database for obtaining usable information. There's also a need for research on international MLAT regimes, a standard for structuring information, a central repository for legal standards, and research on the impact of end-to-end encryption."
50,50,17,Dark Web Crimes,Challenges and Needs in Investigating Dark Web-Facilitated Crimes for Law Enforcement Agencies,"The common themes and terms revolve around the challenges law enforcement agencies face in investigating crimes facilitated via the dark web. These include difficulties in cooperation and information sharing due to different software systems, complications arising from international transactions, encryption and data cleaning protocols, use of cryptocurrencies, lack of training in recognizing relevant digital artifacts, and the need for a searchable repository for digital artifacts. Additionally, there's a lack of awareness about the scope of crimes on the dark web, the need for additional training in evidence collection, and the unknown effects of the dark web's perceived anonymity on offender demographics. The needs identified include the development of training, guides, and repositories, conducting research, and improving outreach and coordination."
51,51,11,Evidence Management,"Challenges and Improvement Strategies in Evidence Management: Compliance, Storage, Retention, and Accessibility","The common themes revolve around the challenges in evidence management, specifically in terms of compliance, storage, retention, and accessibility. There are issues with low compliance to evidence preservation standards, mismatch between data-retention policies and legal statutes, complexity in assessing evidence authenticity, and strain on resources due to storage of large quantities of physical and digital evidence. There's also a lack of efficient indexing for relevant evidence items and differing standards for information collection and retention. The needs identified include collecting data on evidence storage facilities, assessing implications of differing retention policies, developing best practices for digital data availability and storage, creating metadata descriptions for evidence types, and researching cost-effective practices for long-term storage and retrieval of evidence. Additionally, studying the state of evidence-prosecutor-court data interchange and the costs of storing evidence, and assessing the privacy and operational impacts of retention lengths for different investigations and data types are also needed."
52,52,30,Digital Evidence Management,Challenges and Solutions in Managing and Analyzing Digital Evidence in Law Enforcement Agencies,"The common themes and terms revolve around the challenges faced by agencies in managing and analyzing digital evidence. These issues include the lack of technical proficiency due to staff promotions, outdated tools and training, ineffective explicit image detection, difficulty in accessing on-car digital evidence, shortage of personnel leading to backlogs, manual sorting of large volumes of data, technical difficulty in extracting evidence, inability to limit automated examinations to specific categories, and the need for routine digital evidence collection without full examiner involvement. The needs identified include creating a promotion track within specialist units, updating training and tools, enhancing image detection, developing tools for easier data access, better prioritization methods, research on digital forensic tools, highlighting the effect of backlogs, building tools for narrow examinations, assessing existing toolkits for semantic search tools, and developing deployable tools for field evidence collection."
